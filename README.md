# BST-260-Final-Project

#This is our project for our "Intro to Data Science" at Harvard University School of Public Health. Blah blah

#More details about the website:

#It doesn't have to be super fancy and have tabs
#It needs to include text about your project
#What was the purpose/goal(s) of your project?
#Which data did you use? (with a link to the data if possible)
#What insights did you gain from your visualizations?
#What analyses did you do? What conclusions did you make from the results?
#Were you able to achieve your goal(s)? 
#You should include data visualizations
#These can be saved images of plots you made in R

#readme file
#Add text to the README file to help visitors and the TAs navigate your repository.

#An important part of the project is the RMarkdown and associated HTML file. These will detail the steps taken in developing a solution(s), including how students collected the data, alternative solutions tried, statistical methods used, and insights. Equally important to the final results is how the team got there! The RMarkdown and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities explored at each step of the project. We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.

#he RMarkdown file should include the following topics. Depending on the project type, the amount of discussion devoted to each will vary:

#Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.

#Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.

#Initial Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

#Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.

#Exploratory Analysis: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?

#Final Analysis: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers? Note that 1 type of analysis per team member is required. A Shiny app counts as a type of analysis.

#As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your RMarkdown file and compiled HTML file are standalone documents that fully describe your process and results. The RMarkdown and HTML files are due Sunday, December 13 by 11:59pm EST. For instructions on how to submit, please see Submission Instructions below.
