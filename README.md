# BST-260-Final-Project

Group Members: Kelsey Hunt, Wendy Ji, Santana Silver, Sarah Page

This is our project for our "Intro to Data Science" at Harvard University School of Public Health. For our project we explored how different socioeconomic factors relate to disability status and disability prevalence in the US. Please see the descriptions below to understand the files in our repository. 

### app 2.R: 
To explore the data more for yourself, you can use our shiny app. The app is interactive, and will allow you to see some of the different ways we visualized the trends in disability across the US, and across disability type.

## rmd.Rmd:
This rmd file explains how we worked through the data for this project, shows all of our visualizations, and explains our project motivations, analyses, and conclusions. 

## rmd.html: 
This is the knitted version of our rmd file, and can be opened as a web page.

## us_disabilities_2018.csv: 
This file is the dataset that we used to perform the majority of the analyses, and is necessary to run the rmd file.
