# BST-260-Final-Project

#This is our project for our "Intro to Data Science" at Harvard University School of Public Health. For our project we explored how different socioeconomic factors relate to disability status and disability prevalence in the US. To explore the data more for yourself, you can use our shiny app. The app is interactive, and will allow you to see some of the different ways we visualized the trends in disability across the US, and across disability type.
